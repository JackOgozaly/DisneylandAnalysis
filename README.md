# Disneyland Analysis
This repository contains my project on 42,000 Disneyland text reviews. 


## What's in this analysis? 
This project features the use of Natural Language processing to extract insights from thousands of online reviews. The main highlights of this project includes a list of the most talked about rides in each Disneyland Branch, frequently used bigrams, frequent positive and negative words used in reviews, and an analysis of yearly and monthly average ratings. 

## How Can I See This Analysis? 
If you just want to see the important outputs and graphs from this analysis, check out the file in this repository titled "DisneyAnalysis.pdf". 

If you want to see the code that makes this analysis possible, please check out the file in this repository titled "DisneyAnalysis.R". To run this code you will need the dataset of reviews (available on kaggle) and the excel sheet of rides (available in this repository as "Rides_Data.xlsx").
